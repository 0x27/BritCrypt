#*Theresa May Approved Crypto for British Citizens*

## What?
This tool is a message-encryption tool designed so that British citizens can encrypt their messages, and also comply with Theresa May's demands for prohibition on strong cryptography.

## Why?
I wanted to write some Perl, and help our dear friends in the United Kingdom move away from strong cryptography as gently as possible.

## Requirements
Its written in Perl, so it should run on almost anything, but you will need the `Crypt::Rot13` module, which you can find [on the cpan website](http://search.cpan.org/~ayrnieu/Crypt-Rot13-0.6/Rot13.pm).

## How to
Simply run it with the first argument being the file you wish to encrypt, and the second argument being the output file to put the ciphertext, as per the screenshot.

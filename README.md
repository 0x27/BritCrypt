# BritCrypt
*Theresa May Approved Crypto for British Citizens*

## What?
This tool is a message-encryption tool designed so that British citizens can encrypt their messages, and also comply with Theresa May's demands for prohibition on strong cryptography.

## Why?
I wanted to write some Perl, and help our dear friends in the United Kingdom move away from strong cryptography as gently as possible.

## Deps
Its written in Perl, but you will need the `Crypt::Rot13` module, which you can find [on the cpan website](http://search.cpan.org/~ayrnieu/Crypt-Rot13-0.6/Rot13.pm).
